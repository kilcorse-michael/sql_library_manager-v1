# sql_library_manager-v1


A library book catalogue connected to a SQLite db using Sequelize as the ORM, an Expressjs framework, and the Pug template engine

Being Submitted for a Meets Expectations grade to the Unit 8 SQL course for the Team Treehouse FS JS Tech Degree Program

Implemented a Search feature while pursuing the Exceeds grading category, however I struggled with pagination and decided to move forward.

My issue with pagination was that I couldn't decide the best path to take. Should I limit my query results to the SQL database and paginate based upon that? Or load all results from the query and paginate from the Client Side.
Any thoughts on which approach is best is appreciated while you're grading.

Thank you, and let me know what you think!
